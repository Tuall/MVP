# Why? ü§∑

Our goal with this 
[MVP](https://github.com/dwyl/technical-glossary/issues/44)
is to build the **minimal _useable_ App** <br />
that covers our basic "***Capture, Categorize, Complete***"
[**workflow**](https://github.com/dwyl/product-roadmap#what). <br />
It is well-documented, tested
and easy for a _complete beginner_ to run & understand.

The idea is to _ship_ this App to
[Heroku](https://github.com/dwyl/app/issues/231)
and then _use/test_ it (_internally_). <br />
Once we have collected initial feedback,
we can share it with the world!

Once the MVP features are complete,
the code will be merged
into the main
[dwyl/**app**](https://github.com/dwyl/app) 
repo.<br />
However we will also maintian this repo
as a **reference** for **new joiners** <br />
wanting the **most _basic_ version**
of the app to **learn** from.

# _What_? üí≠

A **mobile-first** 
**_hybrid_ note taking**,
**categorization**,
**task and activity** (time) <br />
**tracking tool**
with built-in (basic) team **communication**.

We've found it _tedious_ 
to use **several _separate_ apps**
for task/time tracking and comms ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
and think it's _logical_ 
to _combine_ the functionality. üí°

If the idea of **_combining_ related tools**
appeals to you keep reading. üòç<br />
If it sounds like a _terrible_ idea to you,
please just ignore it and get on with your day. üëå

> ‚Äú_If at first the **idea** is **not absurd**,
then there is **no hope** for it._‚Äù
~ [Albert Einstein](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/110518-if-at-first-the-idea-is-not-absurd-then-there)

## 3 Apps into _One_

This MVP combines **3 apps** into ***one***. <br />
We **built** the 3 _separate_ apps
to showcase the individual features:

1. Todo list: 
   [github.com/dwyl/phoenix-liveview-**todo-list**](https://github.com/dwyl/phoenix-liveview-todo-list-tutorial)
2. Stop Watch (Timer):
   [github.com/dwyl/phoenix-liveview-**stopwatch**](https://github.com/dwyl/phoenix-liveview-stopwatch)
3. Chat (Communication): 
   [github.com/dwyl/phoenix-liveview-**chat**](https://github.com/dwyl/phoenix-liveview-chat-example)

We encourage people to read 
and understand the individual feature Apps
from first principals
***`before`***
trying run the MVP. 
But our _hope_ is that
the UI/UX in the MVP
is sufficiently intuitive
that it **_immediately_ makes sense**. ü§û

## Proposed MVP UI/UX

This is our wireframe UI/UX
we used as the _guide_ 
to create the MVP functionality:

![mvp-proposed-ux](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/73374277-d9445480-42b1-11ea-980a-3fabbfe5a9fd.png)

It is _deliberately_ "basic" 
and 
["ugly"](https://youtu.be/m4isFputh68?t=158)
so we don't focus on aesthetics. üöÄ<br />
It will _definitely_ change over time 
as we _use_ the App 
and collect _feedback_. üí¨<br />
If you want to _help_ make it better,
share your feedback! üôè

Way more detail: 
[dwyl/app/issues/265](https://github.com/dwyl/app/issues/265)

> **Note**: This UI/UX _appears_ 
> to only cover the **`Todo List`** and **`Timer`** features.
> That is a valid observation.
> Hopefully you can use your imagination
> to think of how **`Communication`**
> can be integrated into this.
> If you can't imagine it,
> but are still curious,
> ***subscribe*** as we will cover it later on!



<!--
> The "communication" aspect will be 
> covered by having 
> [***`presence`***](https://github.com/dwyl/phoenix-liveview-chat-example#14-presence)
> in the App.
> i.e. knowing **who** 
> is using/viewing the App at any given time
> with appropriate privacy controls.
> Simply knowing that someone is online (_or not_)
> and what they are working on 
> is a _huge_ boost to team communication
> without the constant distraction/interruption of **Chat**.
> Later (post-MVP) we will implement a very _basic_ Chat feature,
> but it will be _nothing_ like the 
> [Slack](https://github.com/dwyl/app/issues/205)
> or other DeepWork killing Chat Apps.
-->

## Tech Stack? 

This **MVP** app uses the **`PETAL` Stack**
described in: 
[dwyl/**technology-stack**](https://github.com/dwyl/technology-stack)

Going through the individual feature apps listed above,
will give you the knowledge
to understand this MVP.

# _Who?_ üë•

This **MVP** has **_two_ target audiences**:

1. **@dwyl team** to start 
  ["dogfooding"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food)
  the basic workflow in our App. <br />
  It's meant to work for _us_
  and have just enough functionality 
  to solve our basic needs.

2. **Wider community** of people 
  who want to see a **_fully_-functioning `Phoenix` app**
  with good documentation and testing.

_Longer_ term, the MVP 
will also help future @dwyl team members
get 
[**up-to-speed**](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/up-to-speed) 
on our App & Stack **_much_ faster**.
Understanding the basics in _this_ app
will be an _excellent_ starting point.

## Feedback! üôè

Your feedback is very much encouraged/welcome! üí¨<br />
If you find the repo interesting/useful, please ‚≠ê on GitHub. <br />
And if you have any questions,
please open an issue:
[app-mvp-phoenix/issues](https://github.com/dwyl/app-mvp-phoenix/issues) ‚ùì
<br />

### Seriously, Please ***`try`*** it: [mvp.fly.dev](https://mvp.fly.dev/)

1. ***Create*** a todo list `item`; <br />
   This item is **`public`** (anyone can see it!) <br />
   If you want **`private`** items you need to **login**. 
2. ***Start*** a `timer` for the (`public`) `item`
3. ***Stop*** the `timer` for the `item` (press **`start`**)
4. ***Mark*** the `item` as `done` (press/tap the `checkbox` to the left of the `item.text`)
5. ***`Archive`*** the `item` (it will disappear)
6. ***Create*** a new (`public`) `item`
7. ***Start*** a `timer` for the (`public`) `item` and leave it running.
8. ***Login*** using your **`GitHub`** or **`Google`** account.
9.  ***Create*** a todo list `item` while logged-in
10. ***Start*** a `timer` for the `item`
11. ***Stop*** the `timer`
12. ***Resume*** the `timer` that was previously stopped.
13. ***Create*** a `new` (`private`) todo list `item` while logged-in
14. ***Start*** a `timer` for the `item`
15. ***Open*** a second web browser and watch the ***realtime sync***!
16. ***Edit*** the `item.text` for the timer that is already running.
17. ***Mark*** the (`private`) `item` as `done` and see the time it took.
18. ***`Archive`*** the `item`
19. ***Logout*** of the app
20. ***View*** the (`public`) `item` you created earlier with the `timer` still runinng.

That's it. 
The MVP in a nutshell. 
Here's a GIF if you're low on time:

<!--
If you are using the "full" @dwyl App,
and have a question/idea,
please open an issue in:
[app/issues](https://github.com/dwyl/app/issues)
-->

# _How_? üíª

Our goal is 
to document as much 
of the implementation as possible,
so that _anyone_ 
can follow along.

## Run the MVP App on your `localhost` ‚¨áÔ∏è

> **Note**: You will need to have 
**`Elixir`** and **`Postgres` installed**, <br />
see: 
[learn-elixir#installation](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-elixir#installation)
and 
[learn-postgresql#installation](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-postgresql#installation)

On your `localhost`, 
run the following commands 
in your terminal:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:dwyl/app-mvp-phoenix.git && cd app-mvp-phoenix
source .env
mix setup
```
That will download the MVP code, 
install dependencies
and create the necessary database + tables.

the line `source .env` load the environment variables required for the
application to compile and run (see next section).

If for any reason you have an error while running the setup, try to rebuild/compile
the application by deleting the existing `_build` folder and running the `setup` again:

```sh
rm -r _build
mix setup
```

## _Single_ Environment Variable: `AUTH_API_KEY`

Follow the instructions in **Step 2** of
[**`auth_plug`**](https://github.com/dwyl/auth_plug#2-get-your-auth_api_key-)
to create your 
**`AUTH_API_KEY`**.

Once you've got that setup,
you can run the app with:

```sh
mix phx.server
```



<br />

# Build Log üë©‚Äçüíª

This is a log 
of the steps taken 
to build the MVP. <br />
It took us _hours_ 
to write it,
but you can ***speed-run*** it 
in **20 minutes**. üèÅ

> **Note**: we have referenced sections 
> in our more extensive tutorials/examples
> to keep this doc brief
> and avoid duplication.
> You don't have to follow every step in
> the other tutorials/examples,
> but they are linked in case you get stuck.


## 0. Prerequisites

Not required, but recommened,
if you're totally new 
to building **`Phoenix`** Apps,
consider following the 
[**/phoenix-chat-example**](https://github.com/dwyl/phoenix-chat-example#0-pre-requisites-before-you-start)
_first_.
At the very least,
check-out the prerequisites there
before you start here.


## 1. Create a New `Phoenix` App

Create a new `Phoenix` app
with the following command:

```sh
mix phx.new app --no-mailer --no-dashboard --no-gettext
```

When asked to install the dependencies,
type `Y` and `[Enter]` (_to install everything_).

The MVP won't be 
send emails,
display dashboards 
or translate to other languages
(sorry).
However _all_ of those things 
will be in the _main_ 
[dwyl/**app**](https://github.com/dwyl/app)
we're just excluding them here
to reduce complexity/dependencies.

### 1.1 Run the `Phoenix` App

Run the `Phoenix` app with the command:

```sh
mix phx.server
```

You should see output similar to the following in your terminal:
```sh
Generated app app
[info] Running AppWeb.Endpoint with cowboy 2.9.0 at 127.0.0.1:4000 (http)
[info] Access AppWeb.Endpoint at http://localhost:4000
[debug] Downloading esbuild from https://registry.npmjs.org/esbuild-darwin-64/-/esbuild-darwin-64-0.14.29.tgz
[watch] build finished, watching for changes...
```

That's a good sign, `esbuild` was downloaded
and the assets were compiled successfully.

Visit 
[`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) 
from your browser.

You should see something similar to the following 
(default `Phoenix` homepage):

![phoenix-default-homepage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/174807257-34120dc5-723e-4b2c-9e8e-4b6f3aefca14.png)


### 1.2 Run the tests:

To run the tests with 

```sh
mix c
```

You should see output similar to the following:

<img width="653" alt="Phoenix tests passing coverage 100%" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/175767439-4f609357-24c0-4975-a3d4-6ed6057bb321.png">

> **Note**: for the **`mix c`** command (alias) to work,
> you need to add a few **`dev`** dependencies in
> [`mix.exs`](https://github.com/dwyl/app-mvp-phoenix/blob/main/mix.exs)
> to track test coverage,
> a 
> [`coveralls.json`](https://github.com/dwyl/app-mvp-phoenix/blob/main/coveralls.json)
> file to exclude `Phoenix` files from `excoveralls` checking
> and the alias (shortcuts) in `mix.exs` `defp aliases do` list.
> e.g: `mix c` runs `mix coveralls.html` 
> see: [**`commits/d6ab5ef`**](https://github.com/dwyl/app-mvp-phoenix/pull/90/commits/d6ab5ef7c2be5dcad7d060e782393ae29c94a526)
> This is just standard `Phoenix` project setup for us, 
> so we don't duplicate any of the steps here.
> For more detail, please see:
> [Automated Testing](https://github.com/dwyl/phoenix-chat-example#testing-our-app-automated-testing)
> in the 
> [dwyl/phoenix-chat-example](https://github.com/dwyl/phoenix-chat-example#testing-our-app-automated-testing)
> and specifically
> [What is _not_ tested?](https://github.com/dwyl/phoenix-chat-example#13-what-is-not-tested)

### 1.3 Setup `Tailwind`

As we're using **`Tailwind CSS`**
for the **UI** in this project
we need to enable it.

We are not duplicating the instructions here,
please refer to:
[Tailwind in Phoenix](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-tailwind#part-2-tailwind-in-phoenix).
Should only take **`~1 minute`**.

By the end of this step you should have **`Tailwind`** working.
When you visit 
[`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) 
in your browser, 
you should see: 

![hello world tailwind phoenix](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/174838767-20bf201e-3179-4ff9-8d5d-751295d1d069.png)

If you got stuck in this section,
please retrace the steps
and open an issue:
[learn-tailwind/issues](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-tailwind/issues)

### 1.4 Setup `LiveView`

Create the `lib/app_web/live` directory
and the controller at `lib/app_web/live/app_live.ex`:

```elixir
defmodule AppWeb.AppLive do
  use AppWeb, :live_view

  def mount(_params, _session, socket) do
    {:ok, socket}
  end
end
```

Create the `lib/app_web/views/app_view.ex` file:

```elixir
defmodule AppWeb.AppView do
  use AppWeb, :view
end
```

Next, create the
**`lib/app_web/live/app_live.html.heex`**
file 
and add the following line of `HTML`:

```html
<h1 class="">LiveView App Page!</h1>
```

Finally, to make the **root layout** simpler, 
open the 
`lib/app_web/templates/layout/root.html.heex`
file and 
update the contents of the `<body>` to:

```html
<body>
  <header>
    <section class="container">
      <h1>App MVP Phoenix</h1>
    </section>
  </header>
  <%= @inner_content %>
</body>
```

### 1.5 Update `router.ex`

Now that you've created the necessary files,
open the router
`lib/app_web/router.ex` 
replace the default route `PageController` controller:

```elixir
get "/", PageController, :index
```

with `AppLive` controller:


```elixir
scope "/", AppWeb do
  pipe_through :browser

  live "/", AppLive
end
```

Now if you refresh the page 
you should see the following:

![liveveiw-page-with-tailwind-style](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/176137805-34467c88-add2-487f-9593-931d0314df62.png)

### 1.6 Update Tests

At this point we have made a few changes 
that mean our automated test suite will no longer pass ... 
Run the tests in your command line with the following command:

```sh
mix test
```

You should see the tests fail:

```sh
..

  1) test GET / (AppWeb.PageControllerTest)
     test/app_web/controllers/page_controller_test.exs:4
     Assertion with =~ failed
     code:  assert html_response(conn, 200) =~ "Hello TailWorld!"
     left:  "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">
     <main class=\"container\">
     <h1 class=\"text-6xl text-center\">LiveView App Page!</h1>\n</main></div>
     </body>\n</html>"
     right: "Hello TailWorld!"
     stacktrace:
       test/app_web/controllers/page_controller_test.exs:6: (test)

Finished in 0.1 seconds (0.06s async, 0.1s sync)
3 tests, 1 failure
```

Create a new directory: `test/app_web/live`

Then create the file: 
`test/app_web/live/app_live_test.exs`

With the following content:

```elixir
defmodule AppWeb.AppLiveTest do
  use AppWeb.ConnCase

  test "GET /", %{conn: conn} do
    conn = get(conn, "/")
    assert html_response(conn, 200) =~ "LiveView App Page!"
  end
end
```

Save the file 
and re-run the tests: `mix test`

You should see output similar to the following:

```sh
Generated app app
The database for App.Repo has been dropped
...

Finished in 0.1 seconds (0.08s async, 0.1s sync)
3 tests, 0 failures

Randomized with seed 796477
```

### 1.7 Delete Page-related Files

Since we won't be using the `page` meatphore in our App, 
we can delete the default files created by `Phoenix`:

```sh
lib/app_web/views/page_view.ex
lib/app_web/controllers/page_controller.ex
lib/app_web/templates/page/index.html.heex
test/app_web/controllers/page_controller_test.exs
```

With those files deleted,
our **`Phoenix + LiveView`** project 
is now fully setup
and ready to start _building_!

<!-- temp commenting this out as it's a bit of a side-track ...

### Side Note: _Data_-first Design üí°

There are _several_ ways to design and build Apps.
One of the popular approaches 
is to start by trying to define the UI/UX
e.g: by creating a wireframe in **`Figma`**.
This makes an implicit assumption
about how we expect people to interact
with the App.
We often build Apps UI/UX-first
because moving boxes/buttons & text 
around in a low-fidelity wireframe
is a _lot_ cheaper/easier/faster
than writing code. 
However when we are doing an _exploratory_
MVP tightly defining the UI/UX
can create regidity too early.
Another approach is to think about the 
**`data`** we want to capture
and how we may want 
to _transform_ that **`data`**.

For a _much_ more elequent
explanation of why **`data`** first
development makese sense,
watch
"Make Data Structures" 
by Richard Feldman:
https://youtu.be/x1FU3e0sT1I
You don't need to know _any_ `Elm`
to watch this talk.

-->

## 2. Create Schemas to Store Data

Create database schemas 
to store the data.
Run the following 
[**`mix phx.gen.schema`**](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Mix.Tasks.Phx.Gen.Schema.html)
commands:

```sh
mix phx.gen.schema Person people givenName:binary auth_provider:string key_id:integer status_code:integer picture:binary locale:string
mix phx.gen.schema Item items text:string person_id:references:people status_code:integer
mix phx.gen.schema Timer timers item_id:references:items start:naive_datetime end:naive_datetime person_id:references:people
```

At the end of this step,
we have the following database
[Entity Relationship Diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model)
(ERD):

![mvp-erd-without-associations](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/178869576-c6aff9d7-1bc3-43ff-80ac-71b3e86363dd.png)

<!-- probably not needed ...
> **Note**: We used 
> [**`mix phx.gen.schema`**](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Mix.Tasks.Phx.Gen.Schema.html)
> instead of the
[`phx.gen.html`](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Mix.Tasks.Phx.Gen.Html.html)
generator which creates a _lot_ of 
[boilerplate code](https://github.com/dwyl/app-mvp-phoenix/issues/89#issuecomment-1167548207).
-->

In this step we created **3 database tables**;
`items`, `people` and `timers`.
Let's run through them.

### _Explanation_ of the Schemas

This is a quick breakdown of the schemas created above:
#### `people`

The **`people`** (or `person`) _using_ the App
(AKA the ["user"](https://github.com/dwyl/app/issues/33)).

+ `id`: `Int`<sup>1</sup>
+ `inserted_at`: `Timestamp` - created/managed by `Phoenix/Ecto`
+ `updated_at`: `Timestamp`
+ `givenName`: `Binary` (_encrypted_) - first name of a person
 https://schema.org/Person
+ `auth_provider`: `String` - so we can contact the person by email duh.
+ `email_hash`: `Binary` (_salted & hashed for quick lookup_)
+ `key_id`: `String` - the `ID` of the encryption key
used to encrypt personal data (NOT the key itself!)
see:
[dwyl/phoenix-ecto-**encryption**-**example**](https://github.com/dwyl/phoenix-ecto-encryption-example)
+ `status_code`: `Integer` - e.g: "0: unverified, 1: verified", etc.
  For the list of available statuses, 
  please see: 
  [github.com/dwyl/statuses](https://github.com/dwyl/statuses)

We will use the **`people`** schema
later on when we add Authentication.
We're just setting it all up now
so that both **`items`** and **`timer`** 
belong to a **`person`** from the start.

#### `item`

An `item` is the most basic unit of content.
An **`item`** is just a **`String`** of **`text`**.
Later we will be able to 
e.g: a "note", "task", "reminder", etc.
The name **`item`** is **_deliberately_ generic**
as it maintains complete flexibility 
for what we are building later on.

+ `id`: `Int` - the auto-incrementing `id`.
+ `inserted_at`: `NaiveDateTime` - created/managed by `Phoenix`
+ `updated_at`: `NaiveDateTime`
+ `text`: `Binary` (_encrypted_) - the free text you want to capture.
+ `person_id`: `Integer` 
    `person.id` the "owner" of the `item`)
+ `status_code`: `Integer`  the `status` of the `item` 
  e.g: "in progress"

#### `timer`

A `timer` is attached to an `item`
to track how long it takes to ***complete***.

  + `id`: `Int`
  + `inserted_at`: `NaiveDateTime`
  + `updated_at`: `NaiveDateTime`
  + `item_id` (FK item.id)
  + `start`: `NaiveDateTime` - time started on device
  + `end`: `NaiveDateTime` - time ended on device

An `item` can have zero or more `timers`.
Each time a `item` (`task`) is worked on
a **_new_ `timer`** is created/started (_and stopped_).
Meaning a `person` can split the completion 
of an `item` (`task`) across multiple sessions.
That allows us to get a running total
of the amount of time that has
been taken.

> **Note**: 
> The point of having a distinct `start` and `end`
instead of just reusing the `inserted_at`
and `updated_at` is simple:



<br />

### 2.1 Run Tests!

Once we've created the required schemas,
several new files are created.
If we run the tests with coverage:

```sh
mix c
```

We note that the test coverage 
has dropped considerably:

```sh
Finished in 0.1 seconds (0.08s async, 0.09s sync)
3 tests, 0 failures

----------------
COV    FILE                                        LINES RELEVANT   MISSED

----------------
```

Specifically the files:
`lib/app/item.ex`, 
`lib/app/person.ex`, 
and 
`lib/app/timer.ex`
have **_zero_ test coverage**. 

We will address this test coverage shortfall in the next section.
Yes, we _know_ this is not 
["TDD"](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-tdd#what-is-tdd)
because we aren't writing the tests _first_.
But by creating database schemas,
we have a scaffold 
for the next stage.
See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaffold_(programming)

<br />

## 3. Input Items!

Create the directory `test/app`
and file:
`test/app/item_test.exs`
with the following code:

```elixir
defmodule App.ItemTest do
  use App.DataCase
  alias App.Item

  describe "items" do
    @valid_attrs %{text: "some text", person_id: 1, status_code: 2}
    @update_attrs %{text: "some updated text"}
    @invalid_attrs %{text: nil}

    test "get_item!/1 returns the item with given id" do
      {:ok, item} = Item.create_item(@valid_attrs)
      assert Item.get_item!(item.id).text == item.text
    end

    test "create_item/1 with valid data creates a item" do
      assert {:ok, %Item{} = item} = Item.create_item(@valid_attrs)

      assert item.text == "some text"

      inserted_item = List.first(Item.list_items())
      assert inserted_item.text == @valid_attrs.text
    end

    test "create_item/1 with invalid data returns error changeset" do
      assert {:error, %Ecto.Changeset{}} =
               Item.create_item(@invalid_attrs)
    end

    test "list_items/0 returns a list of items stored in the DB" do
      {:ok, _item1} = Item.create_item(@valid_attrs)
      {:ok, _item2} = Item.create_item(@valid_attrs)
      items = Item.list_items()
      assert Enum.count(items) == 2
    end

    test "update_item/2 with valid data updates the item" do
      {:ok, item} = Item.create_item(@valid_attrs)

      assert {:ok, %Item{} = item} = Item.update_item(item, @update_attrs)
      assert item.text == "some updated text"
    end
  end
end
```



### 3.1 Hard-code `item.person_id`






## 4. Add Authentication




## 5. Categorising Items using Tags

An `item` can have _multiple_ `tags`,
let's make that happen with an `item_tags` table:


```
mix ecto.gen.migration create_item_tags_association
```

Open the newly created migration file
`priv/repo/migrations/{timestamp}_create_item_tags_association.exs` <br />
and add the following code to the `change` block:
```elixir
def change do
  create table(:item_tags) do
    add :item_id, references(:items)
    add :tag_id, references(:tags)

    timestamps()
  end

  create unique_index(:item_tags, [:item_id, :tag_id])
end
```

Now run the `mix ecto.migrate` script.
The Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
should now look like this:

![app-er-diagram-with-item_tags](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/68804955-c62eca80-065a-11ea-888b-9391154aceda.png)


### Authentication

With the addition of Sign in with Google
using [**`elixir-auth-google`**](https://github.com/dwyl/elixir-auth-google),
a **`sessions`** table was added to store session data
and the **`picture`** and **`locale`** fields were added to the **`person`**:

#### Create Sessions Table

```
mix phx.gen.html Ctx Session sessions auth_token:binary refresh_token:binary key_id:int person_id:references:people
```


#### Add **`picture`** and **`locale`** to **`person`**

```
mix ecto.gen.migration add_picture_locale_to_people
```

Open the resulting migration file e.g:
[`/priv/repo/migrations/20191130210036_add_picture_locale_to_people.exs`](https://github.com/dwyl/app-mvp-phoenix/blob/master/priv/repo/migrations/20191130210036_add_picture_locale_to_people.exs)
and update the code to look like this:

```elixir
defmodule App.Repo.Migrations.AddPictureLocaleToPeople do
  use Ecto.Migration

  def change do
    alter table(:people) do
      add :picture, :binary
      add :locale, :string, default: "en"
    end
  end
end
```

Now run `mix ecto.migrate` and your ER diagram should look like this:


![ER-diagram-with-sessions](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/73312103-db5dd300-421f-11ea-92b5-e81bce094333.png)


# _Next_

Build the basic _capture_ stage:
https://github.com/dwyl/app/issues/234


<br /><br />



## Run the App on `localhost`

If you want to _run_ this App on your `localhost`,
please _first_ ensure that you have PostgreSQL installed.
see:
[Prerequisites](https://github.com/dwyl/phoenix-chat-example#0-pre-requisites-before-you-start)

### 1. `git clone`

Clone the repository from GitHub:

```
git clone git@github.com:dwyl/app-mvp-phoenix.git && cd app-mvp-phoenix
```

### 2. Required Environment Variables

Create an `.env` file to store the required environment variables:
```sh
cp .env_sample .env
```

The
[`.env_sample`](https://github.com/dwyl/app-mvp-phoenix/blob/master/.env_sample)
file shows which environment variables are required.

For running on `localhost`, you will only need to change the values
for `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` to _real_ values
in order for Google Auth to work.
For that you will need to follow the instructions:
[create-google-app-guide.md](https://github.com/dwyl/elixir-auth-google/blob/master/create-google-app-guide.md)

> If you are new to Environment Variables, please see:
[dwyl/**learn-environment-variables**](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-environment-variables)

Once you have updated the `.env` file with the
`GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` API keys
you have everything you need to run the app.

Run `source .env` in your terminal
to load the environment variables.

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the `Elixir` dependencies by running

```
mix deps.get
```

Install Node.js dependencies by running:

```
cd assets && npm install && cd ..
```


### 4. Create the Database

Create and migrate your database with the command:
```
mix ecto.setup
```
That should create a new database called `app_dev`.


### Start the App

Finally once everything is installed and the DB is created,
run the app:

```
mix phx.server
```

Visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) in your web browser.
You should see something similar to the following:

![app-running-on-localhost](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/73284024-df6ffd80-41eb-11ea-967f-c1eec086fe99.png)
